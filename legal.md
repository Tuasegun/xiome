# xiome.io privacy policy

we try to minimize the amount of data we gather about users, and we do our best to guard data with the best security practices we know

we try to maintain the anonymity of all users

we don't sell data

we record some basic statistics which we might publish, like counts of the numbers of people using xiome

we may be forced to share data with law enforcement agencies

things we track:
1. **email address**  
  this is so we can send login links when the user wants to login. we don't publicize it. we may use the email addresses to notify people about important things related to xiome
1. **profile data**  
  info the user saves about their avatar, like nickname, tagline, profile picture preferences
1. **account stats**  
  like the timestamp for when each user first logged in, and most recently logged in
1. **community data**  
  info about communities the user has registered, including website homepage url, domain names, email addresses of appointed community administrators, stripe information so we can send funds to the community owners when they earn money
1. **permissions data**  
  info about what system roles and system privileges users might have in a community
1. **[stripe](https://stripe.com/) information for payments**  
  we store data about user's stripe accounts and stripe payments, which allows us to gather and direct payments — we don't directly store any credit card numbers
1. **messages, comments, posts, likes, reports**  
  of course, we store the information users post, and what they mark as 'liked' and things like that

we're regularly adding new features, so it's possible this list is incomplete

xiome is open source software, so you can see for yourself what we're tracking — a good place to start looking would be our [database schema](s/assembly/backend/types/database.ts)

if you find anything we seem to be tracking that isn't on the list, please consider adding it to this document by submitting a github pull request for the addition

# xiome.io cookie policy

we store some cookies (localStorage) locally in users' web browsers, to keep them logged in, and to store their preferences for various components and features
